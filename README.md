## Introduction

DS3, a rapid prototype of mine from 8 years ago ([Rapid Prototypes](http://www.the2bears.com/?page_id=1703)) redone in Clojure with play-clj.

You'll need my [pixel-ships](https://github.com/the2bears/pixel-ships) library and my fork of [play-clj](https://github.com/the2bears/play-clj).

A series of small tutorials is planned.
